This is a simple RSS reader written by Neil Morris for Mobile Programming
cs 407 at UW-Madison February 2012 with Suman Banerjee.

The initial screen allows the user to enter in the url of an rss feed to be
saved to the database.  If the url is improperly formatted it shouldn't
be added to the database, but should still switch screens to the list of
saved RSS feeds of the proper format.

From there the user can select a feed to view the headlines of articles
which are clickable to bring up the full description view.

Using the menu button, the user is able to exit all associated activities
with one click in place of repetitive pressing of the back button.
